# What's Next: Park UI Migration

## üéâ Great Progress!

You've successfully migrated **5 core components** (19% complete) to Park UI's design system while keeping Tailwind CSS. Here's your roadmap forward.

## ‚úÖ What's Done

### Components Migrated

1. ‚úÖ **Button** - 6 variants, 5 sizes
2. ‚úÖ **Input** - 2 variants, 3 sizes
3. ‚úÖ **Card** - 3 variants, 4 padding options
4. ‚úÖ **Badge** - 8 variants, 3 sizes
5. ‚úÖ **Avatar** - 5 sizes

### Infrastructure

- ‚úÖ Park UI Tailwind config active
- ‚úÖ Semantic design tokens loaded
- ‚úÖ Documentation created

## üöÄ Quick Start: Test Your Changes

```bash
# Start Storybook to see the new designs
pnpm storybook

# Navigate to these stories:
# - UI/Button (see 6 new variants!)
# - UI/Input (error variant, file upload)
# - UI/Card (outline, elevated, filled)
# - UI/Badge (8 variants including semantic ones)
# - UI/Avatar (now with 2xl size!)
```

## üìã Continue Migration

### Option 1: Continue Now (Recommended Next: Select)

The Select component is high-priority since it's used frequently. Here's how:

```bash
# 1. Open Park UI's Select component page
# https://park-ui.com/docs/components/select

# 2. Study their design:
#    - What variants do they have?
#    - What sizes?
#    - What states (focus, disabled, etc.)?

# 3. Update your files:
#    - src/components/ui/select/select.variants.ts
#    - src/components/ui/select/select.types.ts
#    - src/components/ui/select/Select.vue (if needed)
#    - src/components/ui/select/Select.stories.ts

# 4. Test in Storybook
pnpm storybook
```

### Option 2: Pause and Evaluate

Take time to test the migrated components in your actual app before continuing. This helps you:

- Verify the designs work in context
- Catch any issues early
- Adjust the design tokens if needed

### Option 3: Batch Update Similar Components

Group similar components together for efficiency:

**Batch 1: Form Inputs** (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Select
- [ ] Checkbox
- [ ] Switch
- [ ] Radio Group

**Batch 2: Text Components** (1-2 hours)

- [ ] Textarea
- [ ] Tags Input
- [ ] Field
- [ ] Fieldset

**Batch 3: Overlays** (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Dialog
- [ ] Popover
- [ ] Tooltip
- [ ] Hover Card

## üé® Customize Your Design

### Change Your Brand Color

1. Open `src/assets/park-ui-tokens.css`
2. Uncomment your preferred color:

```css
:root {
  /* --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3%; */ /* Indigo */
  --primary: 217.2 91.2% 59.8%; /* Blue - Let's try this! */
  /* --primary: 262.1 83.3% 57.8%; */ /* Violet */
  /* --primary: 142.1 76.2% 36.3%; */ /* Green */
}
```

3. Refresh Storybook to see the change instantly!

### Adjust Border Radius

Make everything sharper or rounder:

```css
:root {
  --radius: 0.25rem; /* Sharper corners */
  /* --radius: 0.5rem; */ /* Current (8px) */
  /* --radius: 0.75rem; */ /* Rounder corners */
}
```

## ‚ö° Pro Tips

### 1. Update One Component Per Day

Pace yourself! 15-30 minutes per component means you can finish in 3-4 weeks working casually.

### 2. Test in Real Usage

After migrating 2-3 components, use them in your actual app to verify they work as expected.

### 3. Reference Park UI Constantly

Don't guess at styling - always check Park UI's component page for the "official" design decisions.

### 4. Use Semantic Tokens Everywhere

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad - hardcoded colors
'bg-indigo-600 text-white'

// ‚úÖ Good - semantic tokens
'bg-primary text-primary-foreground'
```

### 5. Keep Stories Updated

Your Storybook stories are your living documentation - make sure they showcase all variants!

## üêõ Known Issues to Fix Later

These pre-existed before your migration:

1. **Carousel.stories.ts** - Missing `slideCount` prop (8 errors)
2. **Select.stories.ts** - Missing `items` prop (10 errors)
3. **Steps.vue** - `Steps.Status` component issue (3 errors)

**These don't affect your migrated components.** You can fix them separately when time allows.

## üéØ Migration Pace Options

### Conservative (Recommended)

- **Pace:** 2-3 components per week
- **Timeline:** ~2 months to complete
- **Benefit:** Thoroughly test each component

### Moderate

- **Pace:** 1 component per day
- **Timeline:** 3-4 weeks to complete
- **Benefit:** Steady progress, manageable

### Aggressive

- **Pace:** Batch similar components
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to complete
- **Benefit:** Done quickly, but test thoroughly after!

## üí° Decision Point: Customize Now or Later?

### Customize Brand Color Now If...

- ‚úÖ You know your brand colors
- ‚úÖ You want to see real colors in components
- ‚úÖ You're ready to commit to a palette

### Wait to Customize If...

- ‚ùå Still exploring design options
- ‚ùå Want to finish migration first
- ‚ùå Need stakeholder approval on colors
