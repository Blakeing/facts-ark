# Views & App Shell Update Summary

## 🎨 Complete Park UI Design System Integration

All views and application shell components have been updated to use consistent Park UI semantic tokens with full dark mode support.

## ✅ Files Updated

### 1. **index.html**

- Removed hardcoded `bg-white` from `<html>` tag
- Added proper language attribute: `lang="en"`
- Updated page title to "Facts Ark - Park UI Design System"
- Now properly inherits background from CSS variables

### 2. **HomeView.vue** - Complete Overhaul

**Before:** Extensive use of hardcoded Tailwind grays and colors  
**After:** Full semantic token integration

#### Color Mappings:

| Before            | After                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `border-gray-200` | `border-border`         |
| `bg-gray-50`      | `bg-muted` / `bg-card`  |
| `text-gray-900`   | `text-foreground`       |
| `text-gray-500`   | `text-muted-foreground` |
| `text-gray-400`   | `text-muted-foreground` |

### 3. **AboutView.vue** - Polish & Consistency

**Status:** Already had semantic tokens, added polish

#### Updates:

- Added `p-6` padding to root container
- Added explicit `border-border` to all cards
- Changed checkmark color from `text-green-600` → `text-success`
- Added explicit `text-foreground` to headings for better contrast

### 4. **ComponentShowcaseView.vue** - Already Perfect ✅

- No changes needed
- Already using semantic tokens throughout
- Properly demonstrates all 26 migrated components

### 5. **App Shell Files** - Already Updated ✅

## 🎯 Semantic Token Usage

All views now consistently use these Park UI tokens:

### Layout & Containers

- `bg-background` - Main page background
- `bg-card` - Card/panel backgrounds
- `bg-muted` - Subtle backgrounds
- `bg-secondary` - Secondary backgrounds

### Text

- `text-foreground` - Primary text
- `text-muted-foreground` - Secondary/muted text
- `text-card-foreground` - Card text
- `text-primary` - Primary color text (active states)
- `text-secondary-foreground` - Secondary text

### Borders

- `border-border` - All borders
- `divide-border` - Table/list dividers

### Status Colors

- `text-success` / `bg-success` - Success states (checkmarks, complete)
- `text-destructive` / `bg-destructive` - Error/destructive states
- `text-warning` / `bg-warning` - Warning states
- `text-info` / `bg-info` - Info states

### Interactive

- `bg-primary` - Primary buttons/active states
- `text-primary-foreground` - Primary foreground text
- `hover:bg-muted` - Hover states
- `hover:text-foreground` - Hover text

## 🌙 Dark Mode Support

All views now properly support dark mode:

1. **Automatic Switching**: All colors adapt when dark mode is toggled
2. **Consistent Contrast**: Proper contrast ratios in both modes
3. **No Hardcoded Colors**: Everything uses CSS variables
4. **Professional Look**: Cohesive appearance across the entire app

### Testing Dark Mode:

1. Click the Sun/Moon icon in the header
2. All pages should instantly adapt
3. Try navigating between Home, About, and Showcase
4. All content should be readable and properly themed
